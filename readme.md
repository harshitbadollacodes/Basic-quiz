# A small CLI Quiz App

Thanks for taking out time and reading this doc. 

This is a CLI (command line interface) quiz app. CLI apps are totally obsolete from the end user scene, but programmers use them all the time. 

<h1> What is CLI ?</h1>
When you interact with a program via command line, then it is a CLI app.

<h1> How to run a CLI App ? </h1>
Since this is a CLI app and uses node js, it cannot be run on browser. I have used Repl.it (online IDE) which allows to write code and build apps and websites using a browser. It allows to share the code easily.

<h1>How to interact with an user via the console? </h1>
I have used readline-sync which is a tool to have conversation with user via a console and that is how this CLI app works. 

This is a basic CLI quiz app which I learnt to make by attending neogCamp. 

All thanks to Tanay Pratap(engineer at Microsoft) who is the teacher at neogCamp. 

If you too are interested in learning to code, just go to youTube and search for his channel "Tanay Pratap". All the best.
