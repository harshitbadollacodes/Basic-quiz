# Do you know me quiz?

Thanks for taking out time and reading this doc. I have used readline-sync which is a tool to have conversation with user via a console and that is how this CLI app works. 

This is a basic CLI quiz app which I learnt to make by attending neogCamp. 

All thanks to Tanay Pratap(engineer at Microsoft) who is the teacher at neogCamp. 

If you too are interested in learning to code, just go to youTube and search for his channel "Tanay Pratap". All the best.
